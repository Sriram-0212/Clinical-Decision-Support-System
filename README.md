#Clinical Decision Support System Using Python Machine Learning.
* Developed a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) using machine learning for co-infectious diseases.
* Collected and processed medical data, including patient demographics, symptoms, and laborator results.
* Designed and trained machine learning models for disease prediction and management.
* Integrated the CDSS into existing clinical workflows for real-time decision support.
* Validated the CDSS in clinical settings, demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes.
